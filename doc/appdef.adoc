= App Definition Format

An app definition file, or "appdef," defines the contents of a firmware image.

toc::[]

== Basics

Appdefs are written in https://kdl.dev/[KDL2].

To distinguish an appdef from other KDL files, we require the first non-comment
non-whitespace node in the file to be `app`.

Here is a simple example.

----
app simple-example

board my-awesome-pcb {
    chip stm32f407vg
}

kernel {
    workspace-crate my-kernel
    stack-size 1000
}

task idle {
    workspace-crate task-idle
    stack-size 128
}
----

== `app` (required)

`app NAME`

- `NAME` is the name of this firmware image, and determines (among other things)
  the output filename for a build.

== `board` (required)

----
board NAME {
    chip CHIPNAME
}
----

Defines the board being targeted by this image. This section is very minimal and
will be extended/replaced later. Currently this only gives the board a `NAME`
and references the chipdef.

Attributes:

- `chip CHIPNAME`: references a chipdef by name

== `kernel` (required)

----
kernel {
    stack-size BYTES
    // optional attributes and children go here
}
----

Specifies how to build the kernel.

Attributes:

- `stack-size BYTES` gives the kernel's stack size in bytes.
- `features NAME...` (optional) adds its arguments as Cargo features to the
  kernel's build configuration.
- `no-default-features` (optional) switches off the kernel crate's default Cargo
  features.
- `target TRIPLE` (optional) overrides the target triple used to build the
  kernel.
- `toolchain NAME` (optional) overrides the toolchain version used to build the
  kernel. Note that dotted version numbers need to be quoted: `"1.85"`

=== `kernel > workspace-crate`

See <<workspace-crate>>.

=== `kernel > git-crate`

See <<git-crate>>.

== `task`

----
task NAME {
    // children and attributes go here
}
----

Adds a task to the firmware image, and specifies how to build and configure it.

Attributes:

- `stack-size BYTES` gives the task's stack size in bytes.
- `priority P` sets the task's scheduling priority to `P`, where 0 is the most
  important.
- `wait-for-reinit` (optional) tells the kernel not to start this task
  automatically on boot, and instead waits for the supervisor task to do it.
- `features NAME...` (optional) adds its arguments as Cargo features to the
  task's build configuration.
- `no-default-features` (optional) switches off the task crate's default Cargo
  features.
- `target TRIPLE` (optional) overrides the target triple used to build this
  task.
- `toolchain NAME` (optional) overrides the toolchain version used to build this
  task. Note that dotted version numbers need to be quoted: `"1.85"`

=== `task > workspace-crate`

See <<workspace-crate>>.

=== `task > git-crate`

See <<git-crate>>.

=== `task > uses-peripheral`

----
uses-peripheral PERIPHERAL

uses-peripheral PERIPHERAL {
    irq IRQNAME NOTIFICATIONNAME
}
----

Indicates that a task uses a memory-mapped peripheral from the chipdef, causing
it to be mapped into the task's address space.

Attributes:

- `irq IRQNAME NOTIFICATIONNAME` (optional, repeated): binds the IRQ called
  `IRQNAME` in the chipdef to a notification for this task named
  `NOTIFICATIONNAME`.

=== `task > uses-task`

`uses-task TASKNAME`

Indicates an IPC relationship, where this task acts as a client of the task
named `TASKNAME`.

=== `task > config`

See <<config>>.

=== `task > notification`

`notification NAME`

Defines a named notification bit for use by software.

Note that you do not need to use `notification` to declare bits used in
`uses-peripheral > irq`. Those are implicitly declared by being used.

=== `task > assign-section`

`assign-section SECTIONNAME REGIONNAME`

Maps the ELF section `SECTIONNAME` in the task to the memory area named
`REGIONNAME` in the chipdef. This can be used to place portions of a task's
memory in controlled locations, such as auxiliary SRAMs.

== Shared nodes

[[workspace-crate]]
=== `workspace-crate`

`workspace-crate PACKAGENAME`

Specifies that a crate should be sourced from the workspace containing this
appcfg.


[[git-crate]]
=== `git-crate`

----
git-crate {
    repo REPOSITORY
    package PACKAGENAME
    rev REV
}
----

Specifies that a crate should be sourced from an external Git repository.

Conflicts with `workspace-crate`.

Attributes:

- `repo REPOSITORY` gives the URL of the repository.
- `package PACKAGENAME` gives the package (crate) name to build from the
  repository.
- `rev REV` specifies the git-rev of the version to use.

[[config]]
=== `config`

----
config {
    // arbitrary data goes here
}
----

Provides arbitrary user-defined configuration data to a build. The contents of
the `config` node use a subset of KDL that can be converted to JSON for easy
sharing. Details to come (see examples in the repo for now).
