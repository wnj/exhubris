= Chip Definition Format

A chip definition file, or "chipdef," defines the features of a microcontroller
system-on-a-chip in a way that can be reused across boards.

== Basics

Chipdefs are written in https://kdl.dev/[KDL2].

To distinguish a chipdef from other KDL files, we require the first non-comment
non-whitespace node in the file to be `chip`.

== `chip` (required)

`chip NAME`

- `NAME` is the name that board files will use to reference this chip.

== `target-triple` (required)

`target-triple TRIPLE`

- `TRIPLE` is the target triple that should be used when compiling code for this
  chip, by default.

== `vector-table-size` (required)

`vector-table-size BYTES`

- `BYTES` is an integer giving the number of bytes to reserve for this chip's
  vector table at the start of flash.

== `probe-rs-name`

`probe-rs-name NAME`

- `NAME` is the name the `probe_rs` crate uses to refer to this chip. This is
  required to get full Humility support.

== `compatible`

----
compatible {
    - FIRST
    - SECOND
    // and so forth
}
----

`compatible` provides a list of strings (`FIRST`, `SECOND`, ... in the example)
that code can use to match on this chip, using the `hubris_chip` `cfg`. They
should be listed from most specific to least specific.

Example:

----
compatible {
    - STM32G031K8 // flash size + pin count
    - STM32G031x8 // flash size only
    - STM32G031 // subfamily only
    - STM32G0 // family only
    - arm-cortex-m0plus // microprocessor generic name
}
----

== `memory`

----
memory {
    // children go here
}
----

The `memory` section defines the chip's physical address space layout.

=== `region`

----
region NAME {
    base ADDRESS
    size BYTES
    // attributes go here
}
----

Defines an allocatable region of address space. Three values of `NAME` are
special:

- `vectors` is where the vector table gets placed.
- `ram` is used for task RAM images and stacks, including the kernel stack.
- `flash` is used for task and kernel code.

Attributes:

- `base ADDRESS`: gives the start of the region
- `size BYTES`: gives the region length in bytes
- `read` (optional): marks the region as potentially readable.
- `write` (optional): marks the region as potentially writable.
- `execute` (optional): marks the region as potentially executable.

== `peripheral`

----
peripheral NAME {
    base ADDRESS
    size BYTES
    // optional attributes
}
----

Defines a memory-mapped peripheral that can be mapped into tasks.

Attributes:

- `base ADDRESS`: gives the base address of the peripheral.
- `size BYTES`: gives the size in bytes of the region to map into a task that
  uses this peripheral.
- `irq NAME NUMBER` (optional): associates this peripheral with a system IRQ
  `NUMBER`, and gives it the name `NAME` for reference by tasks. For peripherals
  with only one IRQ, the current convention is to use the name `irq`.
