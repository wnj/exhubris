//! User support library for Hubris.
//!
//! This crate provides Rust wrappers for most kernel interfaces, with a
//! particular focus on syscalls. Every Hubris task depends on this crate (or a
//! similar one implementing the same stuff), so it's designed to be fairly
//! minimal. In particular, `userlib` is designed to not depend on any
//! application configuration state.
//!
//! Routines in this crate are also designed to avoid `panic!` where possible.
//!
//! # Syscalls
//!
//! Syscalls are represented by Rust functions whose names begin with `sys_`.
//! Some Hubris kernel syscalls are represented here by multiple functions to
//! make things easier --- for example, the multi-function configurable syscall
//! [`sys_recv`] can be used more easily as [`sys_recv_open`] and
//! [`sys_recv_notification`].
//!
//! Syscalls are being added to this crate as they get used, so some unusual
//! syscalls defined in the Hubris ABI may be missing. This is likely not a
//! deliberate design choice, so, patches welcome.
//!
//! The full set of implemented syscalls and variants is:
//!
//! - [`sys_borrow_info`]
//! - [`sys_borrow_read`]
//! - [`sys_borrow_write`]
//! - [`sys_enable_irq`]
//!   - Variant: [`sys_enable_irq_and_clear_pending`]
//! - [`sys_post`]
//! - [`sys_panic`]
//! - [`sys_recv`]
//!   - Variant: [`sys_recv_msg`]
//!   - Variant: [`sys_recv_open`]
//!   - Variant: [`sys_recv_msg_open`]
//!   - Variant: [`sys_recv_notification`]
//! - [`sys_reply`]
//! - [`sys_reply_fault`]
//! - [`sys_send`]
//!   - Variant: [`sys_send_to_kernel`]
//!   - Wrapper: [`send_with_retry_on_death`]
//!
//! # Panic support
//!
//! `userlib` provides the Rust `panic_handler` that allows tasks to panic. This
//! is controlled by two features, which should only be set in top-level task
//! executables (and not in libraries):
//!
//! - `no-panic-messages` suppresses panic message generation, replacing any
//!   panic message with the fixed string `"PANIC"`. This can save considerable
//!   flash space in a task, at the cost of making debugging annoying.
//!
//! - `no-panic` converts any `panic!` that is not successfully optimized away
//!   by the compiler into an **error at link time.** This can be used to
//!   prevent panics from creeping into tasks that don't want them. Currently,
//!   _locating_ the panic in question is kind of a pain.
//!
//! If you provide both features, `no-panic` takes precedence.
//!
//! # Startup code
//!
//! This crate provides the initial `_start` routine responsible for setting up
//! the environment for Rust code in your task. It is currently not configurable
//! and should appear as if by magic.
//!
//! # Missing from this crate
//!
//! In the interest of keeping this crate minimal, some APIs you might expect
//! are missing.
//!
//! - KIPCs: since they're expected to only be used by the supervisor task,
//!   they're in the separate `kipc` crate.
//! - Named notification bit access: see the `hubris-notifications` crate.
//! - Task introspection, task count: see the `hubris-num-tasks` crate.
//! - Task slots, accessing tasks by name: see the `hubris-task-slots` crate.
